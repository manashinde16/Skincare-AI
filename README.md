# Skincare-AI
An AI-powered platform that analyzes your skin through images, understands your concerns through voice input, and provides a personalized skincare routine — just like a dermatologist would, but from your device.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To create an intelligent, easy-to-use skincare assistant that mimics the diagnostic process of a dermatologist by analyzing facial images, interpreting voice-based concerns, and offering science-backed product recommendations and routines.

---

## 🎯 Use Case

Millions of people struggle with skin issues such as acne, dark spots, oily skin, or pigmentation but lack access to personalized and affordable dermatological advice. This platform empowers users by providing:

- Non-invasive, AI-driven skin analysis
- Voice-to-text support for easy communication
- Structured, daily skincare routines
- Product recommendations backed by AI and dermatological logic
- A clean, ad-free, wellness-first experience

No login is required. Users can simply upload images, answer a few skin-related questions, optionally record a voice description, and receive a full personalized care plan instantly.

## 🌐 Overview

The platform focuses on **face-only skin analysis** (initial phase), where users upload three images — left profile, right profile, and front view. They are also asked a few relevant questions like:

- Do you have oily or dry skin?
- Any history of acne, pigmentation, or allergies?
- Any medications or treatments previously taken?

A short voice input lets users describe anything they feel is missing. This is then processed by a large language model (LLM), combined with visual analysis from AI models, and used to:

- Understand the user’s skin condition
- Identify patterns like acne severity, dryness, oil zones, pigmentation
- Suggest a **morning and night skincare routine**
- Recommend **specific products**, including cleansers, moisturizers, sunscreens, and treatments, based on skin type and issues

## 📌 Why This Project?

- **Accessible Skincare**: Most users don’t have the time or resources to visit a dermatologist. This app acts as a smart helper, not a doctor, guiding users toward better skin health.
- **Personalized Guidance**: Unlike typical product recommendation engines, this project delivers dermatologically inspired, time-specific routines (e.g., morning/night), not just random products.
- **Voice-first Experience**: Designed for convenience, especially for users who may not want to type long descriptions.
- **Scalable & Ethical Monetization**: Affiliate links and sponsored placements from skincare brands support a free model without compromising user trust.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Extend support to body skincare
- Support for skin condition tracking over time
- Real-time chat with dermatologists (teledermatology)
- Localization in multiple Indian languages
- AI-powered weekly follow-up routines or reminders
